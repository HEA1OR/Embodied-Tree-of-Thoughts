Articulated objects (such as drawers) need to be opened and closed, and if they are not (such as holders), they do not need to be opened and closed. If the task being executed is unrelated to the articulated object, or if there is no task of placing the object in the articulated object, do not open or close the articulated object. \n",
    "2. There is a situation where multiple branches need to be generated: the diversity of object types, for example, if two objects need to be placed in three containers and their corresponding containers are not specified in the task instructions, there will be six branches, or if one of the three objects needs to be picked up, there will be three branches.\n",
    "3. If there are multiple objects that need to be placed in different containers and different branches need to be generated, the order of object operations remains unchanged, while the corresponding order of containers changes.\n",
    "4. If there are multiple poses for a specific grasping action, ignore them and summarize them with only one PICK UP without adding any other modifiers.\n",
