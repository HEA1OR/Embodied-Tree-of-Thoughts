To accomplish the task "pick up the holder", only one stage is involved: grasping the holder. Therefore, the task can be broken down as follows:

1. Grasp the holder.

Let's define the constraints for this single stage:

- Sub-goal constraints
  - Align the end-effector with the holder (marked by keypoint 0).

- Path constraints
  - None for this stage since it's purely a grasping action.

Here's the structured Python code to implement the constraints:

```python
num_stages = 1

### stage 1 sub-goal constraints (if any)
def stage1_subgoal_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """Align the end-effector with the holder keypoint 0."""
    keypoint_0 = keypoints[0]
    cost = np.linalg.norm(end_effector - keypoint_0)
    return cost

### stage 1 path constraints (if any)
# No path constraints are needed for this stage.

"""
Summarize keypoints to be grasped in all grasping stages.
The length of the list should be equal to the number of stages.
For grasping stage, write the keypoint index. For non-grasping stage, write -1.
"""
grasp_keypoints = [0]

"""
Summarize at **the end of which stage** the robot should release the keypoints.
The keypoint indices must appear in an earlier stage as defined in `grasp_keypoints` (i.e., a keypoint can only be released only if it has been grasped previously).
Only release object when it's necessary to complete the task, e.g., drop bouquet in the vase.
The length of the list should be equal to the number of stages. If a keypoint is to be released at the end of a stage, write the keypoint index at the corresponding location. Otherwise, write -1.
"""
release_keypoints = [-1]
```

Explanation:
- Since there is only one stage (grasping the holder), we define a sub-goal constraint for aligning the end-effector with the keypoint of the holder.
- No path constraints are necessary for this stage as it is a simple grasping action.
- The grasp keypoint index is `[0]` indicating that keypoint index 0 (the holder) is to be grasped.
- There are no keypoints to be released during the stage, so the `release_keypoints` list contains `[-1]`.
