# The task involves picking up the holder. Picking up an object typically involves a single stage: grasping the object.
# Therefore, there is only one stage in this task.

Summarize at **the end of which stage** the robot should release the keypoints.
The keypoint indices must appear in an earlier stage as defined in `grasp_keypoints` (i.e., a keypoint can only be released only if it has been grasped previously).
Only release object when it's necessary to complete the task, e.g., drop bouquet in the vase.

If a keypoint is to be released at the end of a stage, write the keypoint index at the corresponding location. Otherwise, write -1.
